I am currently an Assistant Professor (UK Lecturer) in Statistics and Actuarial Sciences at ISEG - Lisbon School of Economics and Management, University of Lisbon. Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Université de Namur, Belgium. I have obtained my PhD in Statistics from Lancaster University, UK, under the supervision of Jenny Wadsworth, where I focused on the modelling of the body (non-extreme observations) and tail (extreme observations) regions of multivariate data, and explored inference methods for such dependence models.

**Research interests:**
  - Multivariate extreme value theory
  - Software development
  - Copula modelling
  - Machine Learning
