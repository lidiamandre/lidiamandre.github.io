I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Universit√© de Namur, Belgium. I have recently obtained my PhD in Statistics from Lancaster University, UK, under the supervision of Jenny Wadsworth, where I focused on the modelling of the body (non-extreme observations) and tail (extreme observations) regions of multivariate data, and explored inference methods for such dependence models.

**Research interests:**
  - Multivariate extreme value theory
  - Copula modelling
  - Computational statistics
  - Machine Learning
